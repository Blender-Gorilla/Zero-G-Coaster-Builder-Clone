🚀 USING THE ADD-ON (START TO FINISH)
1. ✅ Create a Track
Go to the Coaster tab

Click "Create Coaster Track"

A basic curved spline will appear

2. 🌀 Edit the Track Shape
Select the curve

Press Tab to enter Edit Mode

Move the Bezier control points to shape your coaster

To add loops/drops:

Select a segment

Press E to extrude new points

Adjust handles (G) for curve control

3. 🏁 Apply Banking (Roll)
While still in Edit Mode:

Select a control point

Go to Coaster tab

Click "Apply Banking to Selected Points"

Set a Bank Angle (in degrees) — e.g., 30 or -45

Banking = tilt (roll) of the track.

4. 🧱 Generate the Track Mesh
Exit Edit Mode (Tab)

Make sure the track is selected

Click "Mesh Track"

This gives it a solid cross-section (rails/tubes)

5. 🏗️ Add Support Beams
Select the track

Click "Generate Supports"

It creates vertical cylinders underneath the spline path

6. 🎢 (Optional) Animate a Coaster Car (not in the script yet)
If you want to animate a car or add a ride-along camera tell me.
